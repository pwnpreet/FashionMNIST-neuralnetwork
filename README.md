# Fashion -MNIST Neural Network Web Application
This project introduces core neural network concepts and allows user to predict clothing items from grayscale images. (images are attached in image directory for predictions)
The application explains neural networks fundamentals, architectures, key termonologies and provide prediction interface.
This project was developed as a learning project only.
